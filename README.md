# Simp CICD

## What it is

It's a tool to deploy your site online

## What it does

It takes "bash" commands and triggers it when you demand it.

I was tired of the heavy config needed for DroneCI, CIRCLECI and others to work well.
As my projects or so small

PS: optimized for Node.js for now.

## Yes but how ?

It uses cosmicconfig so feel free to use your favorite file format.
And if you are use to DRONE CI, things wan't change a lot.

```json
pipeline : {
  name: "test",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "build",
      image: "node:latest"
      commands: ["yarn install", "yarn build"]
    },
  ],
  trigger: {
    branch: [
      "main",
      "master",
      "dev"
    ]
  }
}
```
